Assignment 8: Array 
COP 1000C Intro to Programming Concepts 
Assignment 8: Array 
Write a simple program (to demonstrate use of array) that asks a user to type in numbers and keep typing in numbers until one of two things happen:
 The user enters -999 
 The total number of numbers entered reaches 50 
Your program will stop asking for new input based on either condition above. Once one of the above conditions are met, the program will output all numbers entered as follows: 
1. 888 
2. 999 
3. 4 â€¦..
and so on. 
That is all that is needed with this assignment (no design tool necessary). Make sure to turn in word document with source code and snapshot of program run with -999 used as one of the numbers entered by the user. (You do not need to input 50 numbers in the snapshot.)
